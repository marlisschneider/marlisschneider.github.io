      <description>About   I am a third year PhD candidate at the department of economics at NHH Norwegian School of Economics and affiliated with FAIR-Centre for Experimental Research on Fairness, Inequality and Rationality. I am a behavioral economist who uses field experiments, lab experiments, and theory to investigate research questions in the areas of education, childhood development and social preferences. In my research, I examine social influences on individual behavior and beliefs as well as their potential consequences for societal outcomes such as intergenerational inequality.</description>

      <description>Get in touch I love getting email. Iâ€™ve met some of my best friends this way, and a thoughtful message from a new person is always a bright spot in my day. I make a point to respond to every (thoughtful) email I receive.
Iâ€™ve connected to a much broader variety of people this way than I do in daily life, and itâ€™s amazing how much you can learn from someone if youâ€™re open to it.</description>
