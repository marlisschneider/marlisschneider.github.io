<p>I employ lab-in-the-field and online experiments as well as survey and administrative data to identify causal relationships.</p>

<p>Parents' beliefs about their children's abilities shape parental behavior and decision-making. But do parents process information about their children's abilities objectively or in a biased way? I study this question in a large-scale lab-in-the-field experiment with Norwegian elementary school students and their parents (N = 743 parent–child pairs) to examine how parents update beliefs when receiving noisy signals about their child's performance in a cognitive (mathematics) or a non-cognitive (prosociality) skill. In mathematics, parents update symmetrically, placing about one third of the Bayesian weight on both positive and negative signals. In prosociality, by contrast, parents apply around 60% of the Bayesian weight to positive information but very little weigh to negative information. The asymmetry is particularly pronounced when signals are framed as reflecting parents' own traits: in this case, parents react roughly 200% more strongly to good than to bad news. Following negative prosocial signals, parents engage in defensive processing: they downplay their child's effort and the relevance of the signals. Survey evidence indicates that these domain differences stem from two factors: parents are better informed about their child's performance in mathematics, and they view prosociality as more central to their child's broader life success. Biased belief updating thus emerges when information is sparse and outcomes are self-relevant, with important implications for how feedback is designed and delivered in educational contexts.</p>

  <p>This paper studies how parents shape the ego-relevant information children receive about themselves and how it influences the beliefs and behavior of children. Using a field experiment with 7th-grade Norwegian students and their parents, we show that parents provide their children with feedback that is systematically more favorable than parents' private beliefs. Children incorporate this positively biased feedback into their self-assessments. The gap between parents' private beliefs and communicated feedback is larger when feedback precedes task completion, suggesting motivational intent. The study contributes to the understanding of how social transmission of self-relevant information, rather than just individual cognitive biases, shapes overconfidence.</p>

  <p>Individuals are sensitive to cues about economic conditions in ways that affect their beliefs and behavior. This paper experimentally tests how parents’ perceptions of children’s mobility prospects affect parental investments of time and money in child skill development. An online experiment involving 997 parents of children aged 5-17 aimed to shift parents’ beliefs regarding the possibility of future upward (downward) economic mobility in U.S. society. We find that parents are responsive to signals about their children’s future economic mobility prospects. Using a novel measure of time investment, parents who are prompted to consider favorable prospects for their children increase their time investments to enhance their children’s skills and report being more willing to pay for resources to achieve this aim. These parents also strengthen their beliefs about the returns on parental investments, highlighting a plausible mechanism. Effects on beliefs and behavior are consistent across parents of varying income and educational levels.</p>

      <p>Two studies examine how American parents’ beliefs about the economy affect their support for policies and behaviors that give them and their child a “leg up,” even when this comes at the cost of other families’ access to educational and economic opportunities. Counterintuitively, the results show that believing in the American Dream increases affluent parents’ likelihood of engaging in such opportunity hoarding. In other words, affluent parents responded to the possibility that other people would be able to climb the socioeconomic ladder by trying to secure their own children’s future opportunities and limiting those available to less affluent parents and their children. These findings deepen understandings of the factors that contribute to rising economic inequalities.</p>

  <p>Using a representative sample of U.S. parents, we examine how parents perceive the pecuniary and non-pecuniary returns to investments in their children's cognitive and non-cognitive skills. We explore whether perceived returns vary by the child's initial level of skills or by gender, particularly in light of growing concerns about boys' under-performance in both academic and behavioral dimensions. Finally, we investigate how these perceptions relate to actual parental investment decisions.</p>
