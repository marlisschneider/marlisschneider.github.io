<h2 id="welcome">Welcome!</h2>

<p>
  I am a fifth year economics PhD student at the Norwegian School of Economics
  <a href="https://www.nhh.no/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHH</a>
  and affiliated with

</p>

<p>My primary research field is <span style="color: #800000;">behavioral economics</span> and I use lab-in-the-field and online experiments to study questions in the economics of education.</p>

<p>My research agenda is centered around understanding how informational and behavioral barriers affect the decision-making of parents and children.</p>

<p>In 2023/2024, I visited the University of Chicago hosted by Ariel Kalil at the Harris School of Public Policy. I hold both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Economics from the University of Mannheim.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; color:#800000;">I will be on the Economics Job Market 2025/2026.</p>

  <p>Parents’ beliefs about their children shape investment decisions, yet may be distorted by
how new information is processed. In a large-scale lab-in-the-field experiment in Norwegian
elementary schools, parents receive noisy but unbiased signals about their child’s relative per-
formance/behavior in one of two domains. I experimentally manipulate the ego-relevance of
the signals by either highlighting that they are (i) indicative of the child’s future life outcomes
or (ii) indicative of the intergenerational transmission of skills between children and parents. I
evaluate the effects relative to a baseline condition without additional information. Compared
to a rational Bayesian benchmark, parents are initially overconfident in their child’s abilities.
They update conservatively in both domains in response to the signals. However, differences
emerge between the domains. In mathematics, updating is symmetric and unaffected by the
information condition. In prosociality, parents overweight positive signals when the signals
are directly and indirectly ego-relevant to the parent. Behavioral responses suggest motivated
cognition; for example, parents downplay negative signals in the prosocial domain. The find-
ings highlight the role of psychological motives in belief formation and demonstrate that infor-
mation provision in domains where parents have limited prior knowledge, such as prosocial
skills, has particularly strong effects. This study provides evidence on belief updating about
someone else’s performance.</p>

  <p>This paper studies how parents shape the ego-relevant information children receive about themselves and how it influences the beliefs and behavior of children. Using a field experiment with 7th-grade Norwegian students and their parents, we show that parents provide their children with feedback that is systematically more favorable than parents' private beliefs. Children incorporate this positively biased feedback into their self-assessments. The gap between parents' private beliefs and communicated feedback is larger when feedback precedes task completion, suggesting motivational intent. The study contributes to the understanding of how social transmission of self-relevant information, rather than just individual cognitive biases, shapes overconfidence.</p>

  <p>Individuals are sensitive to cues about economic conditions in ways that affect their beliefs and behavior. This paper experimentally tests how parents’ perceptions of children’s mobility prospects affect parental investments of time and money in child skill development. An experiment involving approximately 1,000 parents of children aged 5–17 aimed to shift parents’ beliefs regarding the possibility of future upward (downward) economic mobility in US society. We find that parents are responsive to signals about their children’s future economic mobility prospects. Using a novel measure of time investment, parents who are prompted to consider favorable prospects for their children increase their time investments to enhance their children’s skills and report being more willing to pay for resources to achieve this aim. These parents also strengthen their beliefs about the returns on parental investments, highlighting a plausible mechanism. Effects on beliefs and behavior are consistent across parents of varying income and educational levels.</p>

      <p>Two studies examine how American parents’ beliefs about the economy affect their support for policies and behaviors that give them and their child a “leg up,” even when this comes at the cost of other families’ access to educational and economic opportunities. Counterintuitively, the results show that believing in the American Dream increases affluent parents’ likelihood of engaging in such opportunity hoarding. In other words, affluent parents responded to the possibility that other people would be able to climb the socioeconomic ladder by trying to secure their own children’s future opportunities and limiting those available to less affluent parents and their children. These findings deepen understandings of the factors that contribute to rising economic inequalities.</p>
