#### {{< highlight style="bold" text="Disclaimer: Learning in Public" >}} 

I consider this as my space (or rather my lifelog and digital playground) on the internet where I can work on and develop ideas, reflect, and be creative. Opinions expressed here are solely my own. Of course, I try to be correct and write what I believe to be true. However, I am aware that sometimes I will be wrong or my point of view will be incomplete (I try to take this consideration by providing an epistemic status for each post, i.e. rating how confident I am regarding the content).  

Personally, I value discussing different point of views, extending my own understanding of things or simply learning what I did not take into consideration. In this vein, please don't hesitate to let me know what you think or help me understand what I missed!
