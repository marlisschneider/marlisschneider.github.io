## Get in touch

I love getting email. I’ve met some of my best friends this way, and a thoughtful message from a new person is always a bright spot in my day. I make a point to respond to every (thoughtful) email I receive.

I’ve connected to a much broader variety of people this way than I do in daily life, and it’s amazing how much you can learn from someone if you’re open to it. There's another reason I love getting email from people who read my website. This site is where I can riff on ideas, be wrong, and learn from those mistakes. The whole point is to share what I know, and to learn the rest.

Of course I try to be correct, and I always write what I believe to be true, but the greatest value most often comes from someone messaging me to point out a body of research I missed or angle I misinterpreted. In this vein, please don't hesitate to let me know what you think!

# ☕ 

I love meeting up with people in real life. So here is a standin offer-if you fance taking a trip to Bergen, Norway and want to chat, I'll buy you a coffee, no questions asked.

I'm generally available most weekdays after 7pm. Drop me an [email](mailto:marlis.schneider@nhh.no) and include [Coffee] in the subject line, and we can worm something out.
