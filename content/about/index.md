## {{< highlight style="bold" text="About" >}} 

I am an economics PhD student at [NHH Norwegian School of Economics](https://www.nhh.no/en/) in Bergen, Norway. Previously, I was a predoc at the economics department of the [University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk) working for [Teodora Boneva](https://sites.google.com/site/bonevateodora/home). Before that, I spent five years at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/) where I completed both my bachelor's and master's degree in economics.

Currently (research agenda work in progress), my interests span children development, education and intergenerational inequality related to these areas. Furthermore, I am interested in beliefs, social norms and mental models (in these areas and more general) and how these affect behavior and outcomes. I employ methods and tools of applied microeconomics, experimental and behavourial economics to explore and analyze related research questions.

Feel free to contact me via [Email](mailto:marlis.schneider@nhh.no) or on [@Twitter](https://twitter.com/mschneider_econ). You can also find me at office E201 at [NHH](https://goo.gl/maps/BtqYpQdX1MDeqBVUA).

I write some things {{< internallink "/blog" "here" >}} and collect research-related resources and links I personally find helpful {{< internallink "/resources" "here">}}. In the future, I plan to start a research related {{< internallink "/podcast" "podcast">}}.

I like meeting up with people in real life. So here is a standing offer-if you are around Bergen and want to chat, I'll buy you a coffee, no questions asked. Drop me an [email](mailto:marlis.schneider@nhh.no) and I am sure we can work something out.

Also, I like getting email. I think it is a great and frictionless way of reaching out (still fascinates me) and connecting with individuals that can be thousands of miles away and who would be otherwise much more difficult or even impossible to reach. A thoughtful message from a (new) person is always a bright spot in my day and I will reply to every (thoughtful) email I receive.

## {{< highlight style="bold" text="On my Mind" >}} 
An abridged list of questions/topics, research and non-research related, I am currently thinking about or want to learn more about:
* How to generate research ideas/process of idea generation in general
* How to effectively take notes and retain knowledge (articles, books, podcasts etc.)
* Innovative research practices (e.g. bounty hunter)
