## {{< highlight style="bold" text="About" >}} 

I am a third year PhD candidate at the department of economics at [NHH Norwegian School of Economics](https://www.nhh.no/en/) under the supervision of [Alexander W. Cappelen](https://sites.google.com/view/alexander-w-cappelen/home) and affiliated with [FAIR-Centre for Experimental Research on Fairness, Inequality and Rationality](https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair/). My primary research field is behavioral economics and I use experiments (both in the lab and field) to investigate research questions in the areas of education \& human capital accumulation, childhood development and social preferences. In my research, I examine social influences on individual behavior and beliefs as well as their potential consequences for societal outcomes such as intergenerational inequality. Previously, I was a predoc at the economics department of the [University of Oxford](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk) working for [Teodora Boneva](https://sites.google.com/site/bonevateodora/home). Before that, I spent five years at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/) where I completed both my bachelor's and master's degree in economics.

Feel free to contact me via [Email](mailto:marlis.schneider@nhh.no) or on [@Twitter](https://twitter.com/MarMaSchneider). You can also find me at office E201 at [NHH](https://goo.gl/maps/BtqYpQdX1MDeqBVUA).

I write some things {{< internallink "/blog" "here" >}} and collect research-related resources and links I personally find helpful {{< internallink "/resources" "here">}}.

## {{< highlight style="bold" text="Get in Touch" >}} 

I like meeting up with people in real life. So here is a standing offer-if you are around Bergen and want to chat, I'll buy you a coffee, no questions asked. Drop me an [email](mailto:marlis.schneider@nhh.no) and I am sure we can work something out.

Also, I like getting email. I think it is a great and frictionless way of reaching out (still fascinates me) and connecting with individuals that can be thousands of miles away and who would be otherwise much more difficult or even impossible to reach. A thoughtful message from a (new) person is always a bright spot in my day and I will reply to every (thoughtful) email I receive.

## {{< highlight style="bold" text="On my Mind" >}} 
An abridged list of questions/topics, research and non-research related, I am currently thinking about or want to learn more about:
* How to generate research ideas/the process of idea generation in general
* Similarities between the working of startups and the research process
* How to become a better knowledge worker? Effective note taking and retaining of knowledge
* Innovative research practices (e.g., bounty hunter)
