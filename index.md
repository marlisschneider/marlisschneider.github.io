## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marlis and I'm a fourth year economics PhD student at the Norwegian School of Economics [NHH](https://www.nhh.no/en/) and affiliated with [FAIR](https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair/). 

My primary research field is **behavioral economics** and I use field, lab, and survey **experiments** to study questions in the economics of education, gender, and information, both with adults and children.
